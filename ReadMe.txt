This is a simple Data science project and we are working on a simple data with 1 inp 1 out

Business Problem:
We need to check what percentage of marks a student will get if he studies for 2 hours
How many hours should a student study to score at least 60% marks
So, there are different ways to do it , what we will do is we will try doing same by building a model of machine learning algorithm

we will be using following techniques in order to gain the conclusions:

1. Load Dataset
2. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
3. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms ( Data Cleaning, split dataset)
4. Select a model and train it
5. Save Ml Model

NOTE : This is just a simple Data Science project which does not include many techinques like Exploratory data analysis, Feature engineering , Feature Scaling and much more.

"student_mark_predictor.pkl" File is the ML model we save after our whole project has been completed, so to save time and working on data again in same way we saved the model and we can use it furthur to deploy directly.

PreRequirements to run this project: - 

- Anconda should be installed in the PC as it has all the required libraries for this project pre installed
- also Anaconda has certain softwares one of which is jupyter notebook 

open the code python notebook file using jupyternotebook
